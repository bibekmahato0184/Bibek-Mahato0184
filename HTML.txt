        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Bibek, a 23-year-old environmental advocate driven by a profound sense of responsibility toward nature. My mission is to elevate ethical stewardship of the Earth, ensuring that our decisions today reflect fairness, justice, and care for future generations. Every individual has a moral duty to protect the planet, not only for themselves but for the countless lives--human and non-human--that depend on it.</p>

    <section id="mission">
        <h2>My Mission</h2>
        <p>Our relationship with nature is deeply intertwined with ethical principles. We must ask ourselves not only what is expedient, but what is right. The destruction of air, water, and land is a violation of our moral duty to preserve the Earth's ecosystems for those who come after us. My mission is to inspire collective action rooted in ethical responsibility, ensuring that the Earth's resources are preserved and restored in a way that reflects fairness and compassion for all living beings.</p>

        <h2>Ethical Insights: Protecting Earth's Vital Resources</h2>

        <div class="article-item">
            <h3>Air Pollution: An Ethical Dilemma</h3>
            <p><strong>Ethical Perspective:</strong> Air pollution not only harms the environment, but it disproportionately affects vulnerable communities. Polluted air compromises the health of children, the elderly, and those in poverty who may lack access to clean environments or adequate healthcare. From an ethical standpoint, we are responsible for reducing emissions that harm those who are least equipped to defend themselves.</p>
            <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Industrial emissions, deforestation, and vehicular pollution release harmful gases that contribute to global warming, respiratory diseases, and environmental degradation.</p>
            <p><strong>Ethical Solutions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Transitioning to renewable energy reflects a commitment to fairness, ensuring cleaner air for future generations.</li>
                <li>Reducing emissions in industrial sectors demonstrates corporate responsibility toward protecting public health.</li>
                <li>Expanding green spaces in urban areas helps provide cleaner air for marginalized populations.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="article-item">
            <h3>Water Pollution: A Violation of Human and Ecological Rights</h3>
            <p><strong>Ethical Perspective:</strong> Water is a fundamental human right, yet millions of people lack access to clean drinking water due to pollution. Polluting water sources with industrial waste, chemicals, and plastics not only endangers ecosystems but violates the rights of communities to live in dignity. Ethical responsibility calls for the protection of clean water for all, recognizing that every life form depends on it for survival.</p>
            <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Pollutants from agriculture, industries, and urban areas contaminate water bodies, disrupting ecosystems and threatening biodiversity.</p>
            <p><strong>Ethical Solutions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensuring that industries adhere to strict waste management regulations protects the rights of communities and ecosystems to clean water.</li>
                <li>Supporting initiatives that restore polluted water bodies demonstrates respect for both human and non-human life.</li>
                <li>Advocating for the reduction of plastic usage reflects a moral obligation to protect oceans and marine life.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Land Degradation: Ethical Implications of Habitat Loss</h3>
            <p><strong>Ethical Perspective:</strong> The destruction of forests, wetlands, and other habitats for short-term economic gain raises critical ethical questions. Do we have the right to exploit the land in ways that compromise its ability to sustain future generations of humans, animals, and plant life? Ethical stewardship requires that we consider the long-term impacts of land degradation, not just for ourselves but for all species that share the planet.</p>
            <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Unsustainable practices such as deforestation, overfarming, and urbanization lead to soil erosion, habitat loss, and biodiversity decline.</p>
            <p><strong>Ethical Solutions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Adopting sustainable agricultural practices respects the intrinsic value of the land and its ability to provide for future generations.</li>
                <li>Reforestation initiatives embody a commitment to ecological restoration and the ethical principle of leaving the Earth better than we found it.</li>
                <li>Preserving natural habitats for wildlife reflects a moral duty to protect biodiversity and the interconnectedness of life.</li>
            </ul>
